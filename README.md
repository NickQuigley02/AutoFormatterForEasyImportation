# AutoFormatterForEasyImportation
This is a little bash script that takes When 2 work schedules and converts them into a CSV that can be input into google calendar easily.
It currently only works when shifts are given out in hour-long chunks on the hour. 

Things to do:
Edit shift length so it's not all a bunch of 1-hour shifts
Edit how time is handled so shifts off the hour are handled fine.
